# Ivan Bestvina

With over seven years of data science and over nine years of coding experience, Ivan has developed a wide range of data and AI products for startups and large companies. He has a proven record of managing development and data science teams and enjoys building products from the ground up. He specialises in large language models, predictive modelling, network science, and anomaly detection and has excellent communication skills and attention to detail.

## Projects

- ### Datasloth
    
    [GitHub](https://github.com/ibestvina/datasloth)
    
    LLM-powered text-to-code engine, integrated directly into Pandas, enabling users to interact with their data in natural language. Datasloth observes all the data loaded through Pandas in the current Python session, which users can then query and process by simply writing their questions in natural language.
    
- ### DAGpy
    
    [GitHub](https://pypi.org/project/dagpy/)
    
    A data science collaboration tool based on iPython notebooks enables data science teams to collaborate easily by efficiently branching out of others' notebooks, thus minimizing code duplication and providing an intuitive project overview. I was the sole designer and developer behind the project.
